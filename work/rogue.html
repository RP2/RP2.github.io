        <h3>Project: RogueID</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I was engaged to refine the brand identity for a network of creative agencies. At launch the different creative directors ended up compromising the vision for a more corporate outlook. As the network settled in, they wanted to dial up some of the brand attributes their vision and place in the market needed to better visualize.Their network is defined by not doing what the other networks do, they align with the best in class to tackle projects few can. It is this 'break-the-conventions' approach the founders wanted to dial up. The founders always had liked the Steve Jobs quote 'Why join a navy when you can be a pirate?' and in many ways that attitude is key to what this network is all about, doing the unexpected, quickly, without a lot of layers of VPs, to affect challenging creative projects. The net result is this system, that lets the brand tell a story the team can make happen. The execution involved their stealth website, their business system, and all collateral.</p>
