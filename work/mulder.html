            <p>I was lucky enough to be able to be an intern at Mulder Design where I was able to build a new portfolio site of their previous work. The previous website was still using flash so it did not play well with today's hardware. It also did not adapt to screen size so the mobile experience was not enjoyable. The new site was built to fix these issues but also keep the aesthetics and design choices made for the previous site.</p>
