                        <p>A series of gifs I made as a final project for a class in college. There really is no point to them beyond practicing drawing and video editing. I drew the characters in Photoshop, went out to shoot the backgrounds, and then put them together in After Effects and tried to imitate a VHS look. I have since updated my VHS effect so I may consider making more or releasing my process. <strong>Click the image to see more...</strong></p>

                        <h1>ROGUE ID BRANDING</h1>
                        <p>I was engaged to refine the brand identity for a network of creative agencies. At launch the different creative directors ended up compromising the vision for a more corporate outlook. As the network settled in, they wanted to dial up some of the brand attributes their vision and place in the market needed to better visualize.Their network is defined by not doing what the other networks do, they align with the best in class to tackle projects few can. It is this 'break-the-conventions' approach the founders wanted to dial up. The founder's always had liked the Steve Jobs quote 'Why join a navy when you can be a pirate?' and in many ways that attitude is key to what this network is all about, doing the unexpected, quickly, without a lot of layers of VPs, to affect challenging creative projects. The net result is this system, that lets the brand tell a story the team can make happen. The execution involved their stealth website, their business system, and all collateral.</p>

                        <p>What do you do when the established brand of the fabulous Resn group based in NZ and Holland need to expand into the US? I was approached by their US team to closely stay within the brand guidelines, but also show a bit of difference tapping their hat to their new home in the West Coast. This project was more of an application of an established brand to a new environment.</p>

                        <p>I Built a portfolio website for a local interior designer. I also made business cards with a logo and color scheme to go along with the portfolio. The main purpose of the website is to show off examples of her work so the focus of the design is to show off the images as organized and clean as possible. The site also adapts to the screen size so the gallery always looks organized.</p>
