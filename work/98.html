        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I felt like making a test portfolio as if it was on a computer running windows 98. I like the aesthetic older windows had and it is somewhat nostalgic for me. I made the folder and file icons in Photoshop since I didn't want to use one made by someone else or one that was low resolution screen cap. Though it is not complete it was still fun to make and maybe I will add to it in the future.</p>
